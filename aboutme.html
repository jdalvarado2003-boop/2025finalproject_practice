    <h4>About Me</h4>

    <p>Born and raised in Puerto Rico, and shaped by experiences living in the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Portugal, I’ve grown to value people, cultures, and the power of creating meaningful impact wherever I go. I’m a pre-business and pre-law student at Brigham Young University with a passion for building ideas that uplift and serve people. Throughout my life, I’ve been shaped by humanitarian aid, lifelong service, and meaningful non-profit work that have strengthened my belief in doing things that bring joy and lasting value to others. Professionally, my skills and interests span marketing, creative direction, building businesses, sales, community impact, and experience design — all centered on serving people, creating change, and inspiring a domino effect of good that extends far beyond myself.</p>
